# Python Projects

## Assignment_1
### Task_1
- **File**: [View my script : Task_1](assignment_1/mathematical_operations.py)
- **Description**: It takes two numbers as input from the user. Performs the basic mathematical operations on these two numbers: [Addition/Subtraction/Multiplication/Division]. Displays the results of each operation on the screen.

### Task_2
- **File**: [View my script : Task_2](assignment_1/personalized_greetings.py)
- **Description**: It takes a user's first name and last name as input. Concatenates the first name and last name into a full name. Prints a personalized greeting message using the full name.


## Assignment_2
### Task_1
- **File**: [View my script : Task_1](assignment_2/even_odd.py)
- **Description**: It takes an integer input from the user. Checks whether the number is even or odd using an if-else statement. Displays the result accordingly.

### Task_2
- **File**: [View my script : Task_2](assignment_2/sum_of_integers_loop.py)
- **Description**: This uses a for loop to iterate over numbers from 1 to 50 [or any range]. Calculates the sum of all integers in this range. Displays the final sum.

## Assignment_3
### Task_1
- **File**: [View my script : Task_1](assignment_3/factorial.py)
- **Description**: It defines a function named factorial that takes a number as an argument and calculates its factorial using a loop or recursion. Returns the calculated factorial. Calls the function with a sample number and prints the output.

### Task_2
- **File**: [View my script : Task_2](assignment_3/math_module.py)
- **Description**: This script asks the user for a number as input.
                   It uses the math module to calculate the:
                   1. Square root of the number;
                   2. Natural logarithm (log base e) of the number;
                   3.Sine of the number (in radians);
  Then it displays the calculated results.

## Assignment_4
### Task_1
- **File**: [View my script : Task_1](assignment_4/read_file_handle_errors.py)
- **Description**: This script opens and reads a text file named sample.txt. Then it prints its content line by line. It handles errors gracefully if the file does not exist.

### Task_2
- **File**: [View my script : Task_2](assignment_4/write_append_data.py)
- **Description**: This script takes user input and writes it to a file named output.txt. It appends additional data to the same file. It reads and displays the final content of the file.

## Assignment_5
### Task_1
- **File**: [View my script : Task_1](assignment_5/student_marks_dictionary.py)
- **Description**: This script asks the user to input a student's name. It retrieves and displays the corresponding marks. If the studentâ€™s name is not found, display an appropriate message.

### Task_2
- **File**: [View my script : Task_2](assignment_5/list_slicing.py)
- **Description**: This script creates a list of numbers from 1 to 10. It extracts the first five elements from the list. It reverses these extracted elements. Then, it prints both the extracted list and the reversed list.

## Assignment_6
### Task_1
- **File**: [View my script : Task_1]()
- **Description**: This code contains all the learnings of TKINTER from the video.

### Task_2
- **File**: [View my script : Task_2]()
- **Description**: This script creates a basic calculator and performs all the basic operations like addition, subtraction, multiplications, divisions. It takes the input from the user in an interactive GUI session.
